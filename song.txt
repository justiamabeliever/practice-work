I'm off on a adventure (we're good)
"this here is dedicated to all of the kids like me"
I'm on my way to heaven
"wherever you are, now"
Birds seen flying around, you never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
You might hear the birds singing flying around, you never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
Woah now, hey!, Mr.Raaager, Mr.Rager
Tell me where you're going, tell us where you're headed
I'm off on a adventure, Mr. Raaager
Tell me some of your stories, tell us of your travels

Hey!, Mr. Raaager, Mr.Rager
Tell me where you're going, tell us where you're headed
I'm on my way to heaven, Mr. Raaager
Can we tag along, can we take the journey
Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end, when will the heaven begin (yeaah)
You might be knocked down round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end (yeaah), when will the heaven begin (yeaah)
Woah now, hey!, Mr. Raaager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going, tell us where you're headed
I'm off on a adventure, Mr. Raaager
Tell us some of your stories, tell us of your travels
Hey!, Mr. Raager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going, tell us where you're headed
I'm on my way to heaven, Mr. Raaager
Can we tag along, can we take the journey

I really love this song!

Feel good
