I'm off on a adventure (we're good)
"this here is dedicated to all of the kids like me"
I'm on my way to heaven
"wherever you are, now"
Birds seen flying around, you never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
You might hear the birds singing flying around, you never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
You want to be one of them (yeaah)
Woah now, hey!, Mr.Raaager, Mr.Rager
Tell me where you're going, tell us where you're headed
I'm off on a adventure, Mr. Raaager
Tell me some of your stories, tell us of your travels
